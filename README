  Conky (http://conky.rty.ca)

  WHAT IS CONKY?

	Conky is a system monitor for X originally based on the torsmo code.
	Since it's original conception, Conky has changed a fair bit from
	it's predecessor.  Conky can display just about anything, either on
	your root desktop or in it's own window.  Conky has many built-in
	objects, as well as the ability to execute programs and scripts,
	then display the output from stdout.
	
	We are always looking for help, and anyone interested in becoming
	a developer is welcome.  Please use the facilities at SourceForge
	to make bug reports, feature requests, and submit patches.
	
	Thanks for your interest in Conky.

  THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

	Conky is generally very good on resources.  However, certain objects in
	Conky are harder on resources then others.  In particular, the $tail,
	$top, $font, and $graph objects are quite costly in comparison to 
	the rest of Conky.

	If you do use them, please do not complain about memory or CPU usage,
	unless you think something is going seriously wrong (mem leak, et cetera).

  COMPILING

	To compile and run Conky with all optional components (If you run Gentoo, see the "Ebuild" Section below):

		./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-xft --enable-mpd --enable-seti --enable-double-buffer --enable-own-window --enable-proc-uptime --enable-metar --enable-mldonkey
		make
		./conky

	Conky doesn't probably compile with other compilers than gcc and icc. It
	doesn't compile with C89 compiler and not even with pure C99. It uses few
	things that might not exist: strdup(), strcasecmp(), strncasecmp(), optarg
	variable with getopt() and long long (not in C89). Crashes in file system
	statistics stuff when compiled with icc, I don't know exactly why.
	
	You can disable 'drawing to own window' feature in case you don't need it
	by passing --disable-own-window to configure -script.

  EBUILD

	Conky is in Gentoo's Portage.  Simply use "emerge conky" to install conky.
	There is also usually an up-to-date ebuild within Conky's package or in
	CVS.

  CONFIGURING

	Default configuration file is $HOME/.conkyrc (can be changed from
	conky.c among other things). See conkyrc.sample. You might want to copy
	it to $HOME/.conkyrc and then start modifying it.
	
	Configuration file confs

	colors are parsed using XParsecolor(), there might be a list of them:
	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt. color can be also in #rrggbb format (hex).
	
	Note that when displaying bytes, power is 1024 and not 1000 so 1M really
	means 1024*1024 bytes and not 1000*1000.
	
  KNOWN PROBLEMS
	
	Drawing to root or some other desktop window directly doesn't work with
	all window managers. Especially doesn't work well with Gnome and it has
	been reported that it doesn't work with KDE either. Nautilus can be
	disabled from drawing to desktop with program gconf-editor. Uncheck
	show_desktop in /apps/nautilus/preferences/. There is -w switch in Conky
	to set some specific window id. You might find xwininfo -tree useful to
	find the window to draw to. You can also use -o argument which makes
	Conky to create its own window.
