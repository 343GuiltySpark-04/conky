NAME
       conky - a system monitor for X originally based on the torsmo code, but
       more kickass.

SYNOPSIS
       conky [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Conky is a system monitor for X originally based on  the  torsmo  code.
       Since  its original conception, Conky has changed a fair bit from its
       predecessor.  Conky can display just about  anything,  either  on  your
       root  desktop  or in its own window.  Conky has many built-in objects,
       as well as the ability to execute programs and  scripts,  then  display
       the output from stdout.

       We  are	always	looking  for help, and anyone interested in becoming a
       developer is welcome.  Please use the facilities at SourceForge to make
       bug reports, feature requests, and submit patches.

       Thanks for your interest in Conky.

COMPILING
       To  compile and run Conky with all optional components (If you run Gen
       too, see the "Ebuild" Section below):

       ./configure	      --prefix=/usr	       --mandir=/usr/share/man
       --infodir=/usr/share/info   --datadir=/usr/   share   --sysconfdir=/etc
       --localstatedir=/var/lib   --enable-double-buffer   --enable-own-window
       --enable-proc-uptime	--enable-mpd	--enable-xft	--enable-metar
       --enable-seti

       make

       ./conky

       Conky doesnt probably compile with other compilers than gcc  and  icc.
       It  doesnt  compile  with C89 compiler and not even with pure C99.  It
       uses few things that might not  exist:  strdup(),  strcasecmp(),  strn
       casecmp(),  optarg  variable  with getopt() and long long (not in C89).
       Crashes in file system statistics stuff when compiled with icc, I dont
       know exactly why.

       You  can disable drawing to own window feature in case you dont need
       it by passing --disable-own-window to configure -script.

       Conky is in Gentoos Portage. Simply  use  "emerge  conky"  to  install
       conky.  There is also usually an up-to-date ebuild within Conkys pack
       age or in CVS.

YOU SHOULD KNOW
       Conky is generally very good on resources. However, certain objects  in
       Conky  are  harder  on resources then others. In particular, the $tail,
       $top, $font, and $graph objects are quite costly in comparison  to  the
       rest of Conky.

       If  you	do use them, please do not complain about memory or CPU usage,
       unless you think something is  going  seriously	wrong  (mem  leak,  et
       cetera).

OPTIONS
       Command	line  options override configurations defined in configuration
       file.

       -V     Prints version and exits


       -a ALIGNMENT
	      Text alignment on screen, {top,bottom}_{left,right}


       -b     Use double buffering (eliminates flicker)


       -c FILE
	      Config file to load instead of $HOME/.conkyrc


       -d     Daemonize, fork to background


       -f FONT
	      Font to use


       -h     Prints command line help and exits


       -o     Create own window to draw


       -t TEXT
	      Text to render, remember single quotes, like -t  $uptime


       -u SECONDS
	      Update interval


       -w WIN_ID
	      Window id to draw


       -x X_COORDINATE
	      X position


       -y Y_COORDINATE

CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
       Default configuration file  is  $HOME/.conkyrc  (can  be  changed  from
       conky.c among other things). See conkyrc.sample. You might want to copy
       it to $HOME/.conkyrc and then start modifying it.

BUGS
       Drawing to root or some other desktop window directly doesnt work with
       all window managers. Especially doesnt work well with Gnome and it has
       been reported that it doesnt work with KDE  either.  Nautilus  can  be
       disabled  from  drawing	to  desktop with program gconf-editor. Uncheck
       show_desktop in /apps/nautilus/preferences/.  There  is	-w  switch  in
       Conky  to  set  some  specific window id. You might find xwininfo -tree
       useful to find the window to draw to. You  can  also  use  -o  argument
       which makes Conky to create its own window.
