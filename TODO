Heres a very simplified roadmap for Conky.  By no means does this mean any of this stuff will actually get implemented.

1.3
	* simple buttons?
	* icecast status
	* rewrite parts of code, making them more effecient and modular (in particular, the way objects are handled is a complete mess)
	* conditional colours (ie if temp > 40C, make it red)
	* think of new features to add
	* max_width
	* move things out of conky.c, since it's far too big
1.4
	* ideas needed
1.5 (maybe in december?)
	* network transparency
